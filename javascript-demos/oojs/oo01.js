//javascript has the notion of object without needing any notion of class
//to create an object you can simply write
let p1=new Object();  //now we created an object.

//what what are its properties and behavior?
//It doesn't have much information yet.
//but we can add the information later.
p1.name='Vivek';   //now p1 has a name property
p1.age=100; //now p1 has an age property


console.log(p1); //{ name: 'Vivek', age: 100 }  <-- Javascript Object Notaion a.k.a JSON

console.log(p1.name);
console.log(p1.age);
